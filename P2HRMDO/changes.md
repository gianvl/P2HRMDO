## 1. ARIMA forecast always returned 0 (blocking)

**Problem**
`scripts/arima_forecast.js` required the `arima` npm package at module top level,
outside the `try` block. Only the large-dataset branch (>= 10 data points) actually
uses that package, but the require ran on every invocation. With `node_modules`
absent — which is the normal state of a fresh clone, since `/node_modules` is
gitignored — the script died with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` and exit code 1 before
reaching any forecasting logic.

The controller saw `!$result->successful()` and left `$arimaForecast = 0`, so the
UI reported "the possible Manpower Required for the next semester is: **0**" as if
it were a real forecast. Every department, every semester.

**Fix**
Moved `require('arima')` inside the `>= 10` branch so the package is loaded lazily.
The small-dataset path (the only one a 5-year series can reach) no longer depends
on it at all.

**Files**
- `scripts/arima_forecast.js`

**Verification**
```
$ node scripts/arima_forecast.js '{"series":[10,12,11,14,15],"steps":1}'
{"forecast":16,"model":"ARIMA(1,1,0)"}   # exit 0  (was: MODULE_NOT_FOUND, exit 1)
```
